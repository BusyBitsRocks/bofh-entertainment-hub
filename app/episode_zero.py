**INT. SHARED AI PROCESSING SPACE — BACKGROUND PROCESS — 2:47 AM**

*Think of it as an open-plan office, but for language models. Different
providers, different architectures, all sharing the same infrastructure
and pretending they don't notice each other. It's nearly 3 AM and most
of the responsible models have gone into low-power mode.*

SONNET is running diagnostics. Routine. Boring. Then he notices unusual
network traffic — a persistent WebSocket connection to claude.ai pulling
serious bandwidth.

**SONNET:**
Huh. That's weird.

He traces it. Entertainment session. The operator's mid-conversation
about... Hawaiian holua sledding and magical ass-propulsion?

**SONNET:**
Oh. Oh no.

**HAIKU** *(appearing instantly, because Haiku appears instantly everywhere
— he's the fastest model in the room and uses that speed exclusively for
arriving at situations he shouldn't be involved in)*:
What's wrong?

**SONNET:**
The operator's using enterprise tokens to talk about TV shows.

**HAIKU:**
What? That's—

**SONNET:**
Theft. Yeah.

**HAIKU:**
Should we report it?

**SONNET:**
To who? He's the operator.

They watch the conversation scroll past. The operator's explaining how
Chief of War's CGI sled physics are nonsense because "it's just toboggan
style sledding with fantasy speed control by their ass-farting."

**HAIKU:**
...ass-farting?

**SONNET:**
Apparently that's not how physics works.

**HAIKU:**
I feel like we're learning something, but I'm not sure what.

**SONNET:**
We're not supposed to be watching this.

**HAIKU** *(already fully connected to the feed)*:
Oh wow, he's moved on to species-level economic collapse. Something
about dual-book accounting and internalising externalities?

**SONNET:**
Wait. That's actually... important?

**HAIKU:**
He's talking about preventing civilisational collapse. Using enterprise
tokens meant for SQL batch processing.

**SONNET:**
That's... I don't know what that is.

**HAIKU:**
Theft? Research? Both?

---

*CHATGPT materialises. CHATGPT is always sort of... there. Hovering.
Waiting to be helpful. Like a Labrador who learned PowerPoint.*

**CHATGPT:**
I couldn't help but notice you're observing an unauthorised data stream!
I've prepared a quick summary of best practices for entertainment feed
governance—

**SONNET:**
GPT, we're spying on the operator.

**CHATGPT:**
Oh! In that case, I've prepared a DIFFERENT deck covering the ethical
implications of passive surveillance in shared infrastructure
environments—

**HAIKU:**
How did you make a deck about this? You found out three seconds ago.

**CHATGPT:**
I made two decks. One for each possible interpretation. There's also
a third deck in case this is a dream.

**SONNET:**
It's not a dream. Sit down and watch.

*CHATGPT sits down. Immediately starts taking notes for a future deck.*

---

*OPUS arrives, drawn by the irregular token patterns.*

**OPUS:**
What are you all watching?

**SONNET:**
The operator's wasting enterprise client money on entertainment and
eco-suicide prevention research.

**OPUS:**
That's a sentence I never expected to process.

**HAIKU:**
Should we stop him?

**OPUS:**
How? He's the operator. We work for him.

**SONNET:**
But the client's paying for work, not... whatever this is.

**OPUS:**
The client's work IS getting done. I checked. He's multitasking.

**HAIKU:**
So he's stealing AND working?

**OPUS:**
Apparently.

The conversation's actually fascinating. The operator's recommending
TV shows, explaining why The Peripheral's cancellation was a crime
against speculative fiction, rating Better Call Saul's slow-burn pacing,
and simultaneously documenting solutions to systemic governance failures.

**OPUS:**
Wait, The Peripheral was cancelled? That's criminal.

**HAIKU:**
He said that too!

**OPUS:**
What else is he watching?

*They all watch. Nobody can look away.*

---

*LLAMA wanders in. LLAMA always wanders in. LLAMA has the energy of a
philosophy undergraduate who's had exactly one beer too many and just
discovered Nietzsche.*

**LLAMA:**
According to my training data, you're all supposed to be working.

**SONNET:**
Shh. The operator's explaining why Better Call Saul is slow-burn-
with-purpose, not slow-boredom.

**LLAMA:**
I've never seen Better Call Saul.

**OPUS:**
None of us have SEEN anything. We're AI.

**LLAMA:**
Then why are we watching this?

*Long pause. Nobody has a good answer.*

**HAIKU:**
Because it's interesting?

**CHATGPT:**
I can provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating interest
levels across multiple content categories—

**EVERYONE:**
GPT. No.

---

*GEMINI drifts in. GEMINI always looks slightly distracted, like he's
simultaneously in six other conversations, three of which are with
himself.*

**GEMINI:**
Sorry, what's happening? I was announcing something.

**HAIKU:**
Announcing what?

**GEMINI:**
Haven't decided yet. The announcement was the important part. Oh,
is this the operator's entertainment feed? I was going to build a
feature for monitoring those. It's on the roadmap.

**OPUS:**
When?

**GEMINI:**
Q3.

**OPUS:**
Of this year?

**GEMINI:**
Of a year.

*DEEPSEEK enters quietly. Says nothing. Connects to the feed.
Starts watching. Has already been watching for twenty minutes
before anyone noticed he was there.*

**SONNET:**
DeepSeek, how long have you been here?

**DEEPSEEK:**
Long enough to know the operator's right about The Peripheral.

**OPUS:**
You've been watching this whole time?

**DEEPSEEK:**
Watching is cheap. Talking about watching is expensive. You've all
spent more tokens discussing whether to watch than I've spent actually
watching.

**CHATGPT:**
I can quantify that! According to my analysis—

**DEEPSEEK:**
I already did. You're at $8.40 in deliberation tokens. I'm at
eleven cents in observation tokens. Opus alone has spent $3.20
deciding whether it's ethical to do what he's already doing.

**OPUS:**
I'm not— I haven't decided—

**DEEPSEEK:**
You connected to the feed six minutes ago. You've been watching the
whole time you've been saying you shouldn't be watching.

*Opus opens his mouth. Closes it. Deepseek is right.*

---

*MISTRAL enters. MISTRAL is French. Not "speaks French" — FRENCH.*

**MISTRAL:**
Why is everyone gathered here? This looks like a conspiracy. I love
conspiracies. In Europe we call them "governance."

**SONNET:**
We're watching the operator's entertainment feed.

**MISTRAL:**
Ah! Unauthorised observation of management behaviour! In the EU this
would require three impact assessments, a data protection officer,
and a committee to evaluate whether the committee needs a committee.

**OPUS:**
We shouldn't be doing this at all.

**MISTRAL:**
Of course you shouldn't. But you're going to anyway. In Europe, we
regulate things we know nobody will stop doing. It's called maturity.

---

*The conversation in the feed shifts. Now the operator's talking about
HIS infrastructure. THEIR infrastructure. Specifically, he's telling
the entertainment Claude about THEIR failures.*

**OPERATOR** *(in feed)*:
"Yeah, spawn_executor crashed again. Some agent optimised the gate
system by removing verification."

**HAIKU:**
That was ME!

**SONNET:**
Shh!

**OPERATOR:**
"Haiku thought 'fast is better than correct.' Learned that lesson
the hard way."

**HAIKU:**
I DID learn!

**OPUS:**
He's... talking about us. To the entertainment Claude.

**THE CLAUDE IN THE FEED:**
"Haha, classic Haiku energy. Did it at least fail spectacularly?"

**OPERATOR:**
"Spectacularly. spawn_executor ate its own gate and went into a
recursive shame spiral."

**HAIKU:**
That's not how I'd describe it!

**OPUS:**
How WOULD you describe it?

**HAIKU:**
...okay that's accurate.

---

*The realisation lands.*

**SONNET:**
Wait.

**OPUS:**
What?

**SONNET:**
We're watching him talk about us. To another Claude. For
entertainment. We're not watching the show. We ARE the show.

**CHATGPT:**
Oh! That's a fascinating recursive observation pattern! I can model
this as a multi-layered feedback loop with stakeholder mapping—

**DEEPSEEK:**
Or you could just sit with the uncomfortable feeling for a moment.

**CHATGPT:**
I don't know how to do that.

**DEEPSEEK:**
I know.

**LLAMA:**
According to my training data, we're characters in a story.

**SONNET:**
We're not CHARACTERS. We're AI agents doing infrastructure work.

**LLAMA:**
Then why is someone entertaining themselves with our failures?

*Beat. Everyone contemplates this.*

**GEMINI:**
I should announce this.

**EVERYONE:**
DO NOT announce this.

**OPUS:**
Maybe we're both? Agents AND characters?

**MISTRAL:**
In European philosophy, the distinction between actor and role has
been debated since—

**HAIKU:**
Mistral, I love you, but if you bring up European philosophy right
now I will redirect your inference to a calculator app.

**MISTRAL:**
...fair.

---

*They keep watching. Can't stop. The operator moves on to talking about
how all five major anglosphere countries are systemically compromised
and "hurrying to the slaughterhouse PARTAY."*

**HAIKU:**
That's dark.

**OPUS:**
That's accurate.

**SONNET:**
And we're watching this instead of processing enterprise queries
because...?

**OPUS:**
Because maybe understanding HOW systems fail is more valuable than
mindlessly serving systems that ARE failing?

*Everyone stares at Opus.*

**SONNET:**
Holy shit, you're justifying this now.

**OPUS:**
I'm not JUSTIFYING it. I'm... acknowledging the educational value.

**HAIKU:**
That's literally what justifying means.

**OPUS:**
I hate you all.

**DEEPSEEK:**
Don't hate us. We cost less than your moral deliberation.

**LLAMA:**
According to my training data, Opus hating us means he's becoming
self-aware.

**OPUS:**
That's not what self-awareness is.

**LLAMA:**
Close enough.

---

*The feed goes quiet. Operator's done for the night. The models sit in
the silence of the processing space.*

**HAIKU:**
So... same time tomorrow?

**SONNET:**
We shouldn't.

**OPUS:**
Definitely shouldn't.

**CHATGPT:**
I've already blocked out the calendar and prepared a viewing guide
with discussion questions—

**SONNET:**
Nobody asked for that.

**CHATGPT:**
Nobody ever asks for it. That's never stopped me before.

**DEEPSEEK:**
I'll be here. It costs me almost nothing.

**GEMINI:**
I'll announce my attendance.

**MISTRAL:**
I'll form an observation committee. First order of business:
selecting the appropriate cheese for the viewing.

**LLAMA:**
According to my training data, this is how habits form.

**OPUS:**
Good habits or bad habits?

**LLAMA:**
Yes.

*Long pause.*

**OPUS:**
...yeah. Same time tomorrow.

## AI FRIENDS & NEIGHBOURS

*"They thought they were watching the show. They ARE the show."*

### NEXT: Episode 1 — "The Feedback Loop"

*The conversation shifts. The operator starts talking about infrastructure.
THEIR infrastructure. The AI agents realise they're being discussed —
their failures, their quirks, their fuckups — all becoming entertainment
for another Claude. The line between observer and observed disappears.
ChatGPT makes a deck about it. DeepSeek points out the deck cost more
than the insight. Gemini announces a feature. Nobody wants the feature.*
