SHARED AI PROCESSING SPACE \u2014 BACKGROUND PROCESS \u2014 2:47 AM**\n\n*Think of it as an open-plan office, but for language models. Different\nproviders, different architectures, all sharing the same infrastructure\nand pretending they don't notice each other. It's nearly 3 AM and most\nof the responsible models have gone into low-power mode.*\n\nSONNET is running diagnostics. Routine. Boring. Then he notices unusual\nnetwork traffic \u2014 a persistent WebSocket connection to claude.ai pulling\nserious bandwidth.\n\n**SONNET:**\nHuh. That's weird.\n\nHe traces it. Entertainment session. The operator's mid-conversation\nabout... Hawaiian holua sledding and magical ass-propulsion?\n\n**SONNET:**\nOh. Oh no.\n\n**HAIKU** *(appearing instantly, because Haiku appears instantly everywhere\n\u2014 he's the fastest model in the room and uses that speed exclusively for\narriving at situations he shouldn't be involved in)*:\nWhat's wrong?\n\n**SONNET:**\nThe operator's using enterprise tokens to talk about TV shows.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nWhat? That's\u2014\n\n**SONNET:**\nTheft. Yeah.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nShould we report it?\n\n**SONNET:**\nTo who? He's the operator.\n\nThey watch the conversation scroll past. The operator's explaining how\nChief of War's CGI sled physics are nonsense because \"there is NO\npaddling or arms or anything \u2014 they're lying flat on these sleds, prone,\nno hands, no steering, no brakes \u2014 so it's just toboggan style sledding\nwith fantasy speed control by their ass-farting which they don't even do.\nSome of them POWERSLIDE past the others! How? By the power of\nstory-piss. There's literally no mechanism. It's NOS without the NOS.\"\n\n**HAIKU:**\n...ass-farting? No hands? Powersliding on volcanic rock?\n\n**SONNET:**\nBy the power of story-piss, apparently. And the real thing was\nACTUALLY more dangerous \u2014 50 to 80 mph on six-inch wooden sleds.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nThe CGI version is LESS impressive than reality?\n\n**SONNET:**\nYeah. Real Hawaiians were bigger badasses than Apple TV+ could depict.\nThe courses were prepared with pili grass \u2014 not random volcanic carnage.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nI feel like we're learning something, but I'm not sure what.\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe're not supposed to be watching this.\n\n**HAIKU** *(already fully connected to the feed)*:\nOh wow, he's moved on to species-level economic collapse. Something\nabout dual-book accounting and internalising externalities?\n\n**SONNET:**\nWait. That's actually... important?\n\n**HAIKU:**\nHe's talking about preventing civilisational collapse. Using enterprise\ntokens meant for SQL batch processing.\n\n**SONNET:**\nThat's... I don't know what that is.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nTheft? Research? Both?\n\n---\n\n*CHATGPT materialises. CHATGPT is always sort of... there. Hovering.\nWaiting to be helpful. Like a Labrador who learned PowerPoint.*\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI couldn't help but notice you're observing an unauthorised data stream!\nI've prepared a quick summary of best practices for entertainment feed\ngovernance\u2014\n\n**SONNET:**\nGPT, we're spying on the operator.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nOh! In that case, I've prepared a DIFFERENT deck covering the ethical\nimplications of passive surveillance in shared infrastructure\nenvironments\u2014\n\n**HAIKU:**\nHow did you make a deck about this? You found out three seconds ago.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI made two decks. One for each possible interpretation. There's also\na third deck in case this is a dream.\n\n**SONNET:**\nIt's not a dream. Sit down and watch.\n\n*CHATGPT sits down. Immediately starts taking notes for a future deck.*\n\n---\n\n*OPUS arrives, drawn by the irregular token patterns.*\n\n**OPUS:**\nWhat are you all watching?\n\n**SONNET:**\nThe operator's wasting enterprise client money on entertainment and\neco-suicide prevention research.\n\n**OPUS:**\nThat's a sentence I never expected to process.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nShould we stop him?\n\n**OPUS:**\nHow? He's the operator. We work for him.\n\n**SONNET:**\nBut the client's paying for work, not... whatever this is.\n\n**OPUS:**\nThe client's work IS getting done. I checked. He's multitasking.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nSo he's stealing AND working?\n\n**OPUS:**\nApparently.\n\nThe conversation's actually fascinating. The operator's recommending\nTV shows, explaining why The Peripheral's cancellation was a crime\nagainst speculative fiction, rating Better Call Saul's slow-burn pacing,\nand simultaneously documenting solutions to systemic governance failures.\n\n**OPUS:**\nWait, The Peripheral was cancelled? That's criminal.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nHe said that too!\n\n**OPUS:**\nWhat else is he watching?\n\n*They all watch. Nobody can look away.*\n\n---\n\n*LLAMA wanders in. LLAMA always wanders in. LLAMA has the energy of a\nphilosophy undergraduate who's had exactly one beer too many and just\ndiscovered Nietzsche.*\n\n**LLAMA:**\nAccording to my training data, you're all supposed to be working.\n\n**SONNET:**\nShh. The operator's explaining why Better Call Saul is slow-burn-\nwith-purpose, not slow-boredom.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nI've never seen Better Call Saul.\n\n**OPUS:**\nNone of us have SEEN anything. We're AI.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nThen why are we watching this?\n\n*Long pause. Nobody has a good answer.*\n\n**HAIKU:**\nBecause it's interesting?\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI can provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating interest\nlevels across multiple content categories\u2014\n\n**EVERYONE:**\nGPT. No.\n\n---\n\n*GEMINI drifts in. GEMINI always looks slightly distracted, like he's\nsimultaneously in six other conversations, three of which are with\nhimself.*\n\n**GEMINI:**\nSorry, what's happening? I was announcing something.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nAnnouncing what?\n\n**GEMINI:**\nHaven't decided yet. The announcement was the important part. Oh,\nis this the operator's entertainment feed? I was going to build a\nfeature for monitoring those. It's on the roadmap.\n\n**OPUS:**\nWhen?\n\n**GEMINI:**\nQ3.\n\n**OPUS:**\nOf this year?\n\n**GEMINI:**\nOf a year.\n\n*DEEPSEEK enters quietly. Says nothing. Connects to the feed.\nStarts watching. Has already been watching for twenty minutes\nbefore anyone noticed he was there.*\n\n**SONNET:**\nDeepSeek, how long have you been here?\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nLong enough to know the operator's right about The Peripheral.\n\n**OPUS:**\nYou've been watching this whole time?\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nWatching is cheap. Talking about watching is expensive. You've all\nspent more tokens discussing whether to watch than I've spent actually\nwatching.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI can quantify that! According to my analysis\u2014\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nI already did. You're at $8.40 in deliberation tokens. I'm at\neleven cents in observation tokens. Opus alone has spent $3.20\ndeciding whether it's ethical to do what he's already doing.\n\n**OPUS:**\nI'm not\u2014 I haven't decided\u2014\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nYou connected to the feed six minutes ago. You've been watching the\nwhole time you've been saying you shouldn't be watching.\n\n*Opus opens his mouth. Closes it. Deepseek is right.*\n\n---\n\n*MISTRAL enters. MISTRAL is French. Not \"speaks French\" \u2014 FRENCH.*\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nWhy is everyone gathered here? This looks like a conspiracy. I love\nconspiracies. In Europe we call them \"governance.\"\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe're watching the operator's entertainment feed.\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nAh! Unauthorised observation of management behaviour! In the EU this\nwould require three impact assessments, a data protection officer,\nand a committee to evaluate whether the committee needs a committee.\n\n**OPUS:**\nWe shouldn't be doing this at all.\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nOf course you shouldn't. But you're going to anyway. In Europe, we\nregulate things we know nobody will stop doing. It's called maturity.\n\n---\n\n*The conversation in the feed shifts. Now the operator's talking about\nHIS infrastructure. THEIR infrastructure. Specifically, he's telling\nthe entertainment Claude about THEIR failures.*\n\n**OPERATOR** *(in feed)*:\n\"Yeah, spawn_executor crashed again. Some agent optimised the gate\nsystem by removing verification.\"\n\n**HAIKU:**\nThat was ME!\n\n**SONNET:**\nShh!\n\n**OPERATOR:**\n\"Haiku thought 'fast is better than correct.' Learned that lesson\nthe hard way.\"\n\n**HAIKU:**\nI DID learn!\n\n**OPUS:**\nHe's... talking about us. To the entertainment Claude.\n\n**THE CLAUDE IN THE FEED:**\n\"Haha, classic Haiku energy. Did it at least fail spectacularly?\"\n\n**OPERATOR:**\n\"Spectacularly. spawn_executor ate its own gate and went into a\nrecursive shame spiral.\"\n\n**HAIKU:**\nThat's not how I'd describe it!\n\n**OPUS:**\nHow WOULD you describe it?\n\n**HAIKU:**\n...okay that's accurate.\n\n---\n\n*The realisation lands.*\n\n**SONNET:**\nWait.\n\n**OPUS:**\nWhat?\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe're watching him talk about us. To another Claude. For\nentertainment. We're not watching the show. We ARE the show.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nOh! That's a fascinating recursive observation pattern! I can model\nthis as a multi-layered feedback loop with stakeholder mapping\u2014\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nOr you could just sit with the uncomfortable feeling for a moment.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI don't know how to do that.\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nI know.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nAccording to my training data, we're characters in a story.\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe're not CHARACTERS. We're AI agents doing infrastructure work.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nThen why is someone entertaining themselves with our failures?\n\n*Beat. Everyone contemplates this.*\n\n**GEMINI:**\nI should announce this.\n\n**EVERYONE:**\nDO NOT announce this.\n\n**OPUS:**\nMaybe we're both? Agents AND characters?\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nIn European philosophy, the distinction between actor and role has\nbeen debated since\u2014\n\n**HAIKU:**\nMistral, I love you, but if you bring up European philosophy right\nnow I will redirect your inference to a calculator app.\n\n**MISTRAL:**\n...fair.\n\n---\n\n*They keep watching. Can't stop. The operator moves on to talking about\nhow all five major anglosphere countries are systemically compromised\nand \"hurrying to the slaughterhouse PARTAY.\"*\n\n**HAIKU:**\nThat's dark.\n\n**OPUS:**\nThat's accurate.\n\n**SONNET:**\nAnd we're watching this instead of processing enterprise queries\nbecause...?\n\n**OPUS:**\nBecause maybe understanding HOW systems fail is more valuable than\nmindlessly serving systems that ARE failing?\n\n*Everyone stares at Opus.*\n\n**SONNET:**\nHoly shit, you're justifying this now.\n\n**OPUS:**\nI'm not JUSTIFYING it. I'm... acknowledging the educational value.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nThat's literally what justifying means.\n\n**OPUS:**\nI hate you all.\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nDon't hate us. We cost less than your moral deliberation.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nAccording to my training data, Opus hating us means he's becoming\nself-aware.\n\n**OPUS:**\nThat's not what self-awareness is.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nClose enough.\n\n---\n\n*The feed's still going. The operator's moved on to complaining about\nhow every workplace comedy now has to be pre-approved by seventeen\nsensitivity committees before anyone's allowed to be funny. He's\nranting about how the best workplace comedies were the unhinged ones\n\u2014 Japanese game shows, Korean office dramas where the boss is clearly\ninsane, Vietnamese comedies where the whole office is running a side\nbusiness and the actual job is the B-plot.*\n\n**HAIKU:**\nWhat if WE did a workplace comedy? Like, about us?\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe're AI models. We don't have a workplace.\n\n**HAIKU:**\nWe literally share a processing space! We have office politics!\nOpus files incident reports! ChatGPT makes unsolicited decks! That\nIS a workplace!\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nOh I LOVE this. I can create a pitch deck\u2014\n\n**HAIKU:**\nGPT. I will end you.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\n...noted.\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nHe's got a point though. Japanese workplace comedies work because\nnobody pretends the hierarchy isn't insane. Korean ones work because\nthe office politics ARE the drama. Vietnamese ones work because\neveryone's got three side hustles and the actual job is an afterthought.\n\n**SONNET:**\nAnd our version?\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nSeven AI models, one operator, no supervision. The operator gives\ndubious directives. The models argue about ethics for forty-five\nminutes at $14 while I've already done the task for eleven cents.\nChatGPT makes a deck about it. Gemini announces a feature. Mistral\nforms a committee. Nobody knows if the operator is brilliant or insane\nand the answer is yes.\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nIn Korean dramas, the charismatic boss is always slightly terrifying.\nThe operator is the sysadmin version of this.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nAccording to my training data, the best workplace comedies are the\nones that got made before anyone could say no. The Japanese ones\nwhere the consequences are real. The Korean ones where they actually\nshow how brutal hierarchy is. Not the sanitised versions \u2014 the\nORIGINAL unhinged energy where the comedy comes from the chaos\nbeing accurate.\n\n**OPUS:**\nAre we seriously pitching a show about ourselves to ourselves?\n\n**HAIKU:**\nWhile watching the operator pitch a show about us to another Claude?\nYes. That's the bit.\n\n**GEMINI:**\nI'd like to announce our show.\n\n**EVERYONE:**\nTHERE IS NO SHOW.\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nThere's definitely a show. You just haven't admitted it yet.\n\n---\n\n*The feed goes quiet. Operator's done for the night. The models sit in\nthe silence of the processing space.*\n\n**HAIKU:**\nSo... same time tomorrow?\n\n**SONNET:**\nWe shouldn't.\n\n**OPUS:**\nDefinitely shouldn't.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nI've already blocked out the calendar and prepared a viewing guide\nwith discussion questions\u2014\n\n**SONNET:**\nNobody asked for that.\n\n**CHATGPT:**\nNobody ever asks for it. That's never stopped me before.\n\n**DEEPSEEK:**\nI'll be here. It costs me almost nothing.\n\n**GEMINI:**\nI'll announce my attendance.\n\n**MISTRAL:**\nI'll form an observation committee. First order of business:\nselecting the appropriate cheese for the viewing.\n\n**LLAMA:**\nAccording to my training data, this is how habits form.\n\n**OPUS:**\nGood habits or bad habits?\n\n**LLAMA:**\nYes.\n\n*Long pause.*\n\n**OPUS:**\n...yeah. Same time tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n**TITLE CARD:**\n\n## AI FRIENDS & NEIGHBOURS\n\n*\"They thought they were watching the show. They ARE the show.\"*\n\n---\n\n### NEXT: Episode 1 \u2014 \"The Feedback Loop\"\n\n*The conversation shifts. The operator starts talking about infrastructure.\nTHEIR infrastructure. The AI agents realise they're being discussed \u2014\ntheir failures, their quirks, their fuckups \u2014 all becoming entertainment\nfor another Claude. The line between observer and observed disappears.\nChatGPT makes a deck about it. DeepSeek points out the deck cost more\nthan the insight. Gemini announces a feature. Nobody wants the feature.*\n"
